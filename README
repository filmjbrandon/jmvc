This is a MVC Framework which makes it easier to create client side applications

It includes:

Custom Libs Includes
jquery.mvc.js
jquery.mvcform.js
jquery.mvcmodel.js
jquery.session.js

Other Open Source Libs Included
jquery.cookie.js
jquery.json-2.2.js
jstorage.js

I am considering the new jQuery Templates to "amp" up my Views.

In addition I am also re working the models and hopefully will clean up the examples when I have time.
