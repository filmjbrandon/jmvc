This is a MVC Framework which makes it easier to create client side applications

It includes:

My Libs Includes
jquery.mvcboot.js - configs and boot strap
jquery.mvc.js - core functions
jquery.mvcform.js - form functions
jquery.mvcmodel.js - model functions
jquery.session.js - simulated sessions

Other 3rd Party Open Source libraries used
jquery.cookie.js
jquery.json-2.2.js
jstorage.js
jquery.tmpl.js

In addition I am also re working the models and hopefully will clean up the examples when I have time.
